				<h3 class="bold">Here's a time line of Dr.Borlaug's life:</h3>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="bold">1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,</br>
						thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth</br>
						Administration"</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1935</span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian</br>
						Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food changed</br>
						them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1937</span> - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1938</span> - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to budget</br>
						cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school study under</br>
						Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1941</span> - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is</br>
						rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT</br>
						to control malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1942</span> - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1944</span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his</br>
						pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program.</br>
						Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of disease</br>
						resistent wheat - including different varieties for each major climate on Earth.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1945</span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat yields</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1953</span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling</br>
						American breed, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes on</br>
						to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1962</span> - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the</br>
						Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly</br>
						expanding population</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1970</span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1983</span> - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize and</br>
						sorghum yields</li>
					<li><span class="bold">1984</span> - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
					<li><span class="bold">2005</span> - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."</br>
						Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the</br>
						demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently</br>
						dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals</br>
						for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the</br>
						best breeds."</li>
					<li><span class="bold">2009</span> - dies at the age of 95.</li>
				</ul>
				<ul>
					<li class="italic">"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching</br>
						contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific</br>
						vision can make to human peace and progress."</br></li>
					<li class="italic">-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh</li>
